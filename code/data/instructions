This folder will house the all the images of the alphabets signs you want to use to train your model.

When collecting your data sample, 
-- Choose either your left or right hand and be consistent with it.
-- Don't let your other hand come to the camera's view when collecting the data.
-- Move your hand with the sign towards the camera and away from the camera.
-- The program is going to take 100 pictures for each alphabets so make sure to move your hand around a bit to get different angles.
-- Once your start, if you make a mistake you will have to delete all your progress and restart the whole process so please be careful.
-- All the pictures for each alphabet will be placed in separate folders inside this data folder.

I have provided an example of myself making the sign for the alphabet 'A' to illustrate how you should move your hand towards and away from the camera

Good luck!
